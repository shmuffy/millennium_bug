## About
Scroll (literally) through time as you see the website morph chronologically from the 1990s to the present. We wanted a website to bring back old memories - the good and the bad. Remember that "awesome" Windows XP error sound - we have that. Remember the Internet Explorer crash dialog window - we have that too.

## Demo (including a video and screenshots) - TLDR
Please see the project on devpost (https://devpost.com/software/travel-through-time-an-immersive-morphing-website). There's a video and some screenshots.
